###Project Proposal Guideline

### Alexis Harrison, Brandon Long, Eston Jeffries

Upon discussing the project among our team members, we came to a collective decision to develop an 
application that we would use ourselves, based off of our shared interest. While we are a team 
built of Computer Scientists and Engineers, we realized we have more in common beyond the ability 
to code. The motivation behind our project is the passion we all share for music. With that in mind, 
we chose to create a web application called AggieTube, incorporating the tools of searching and 
storing music videos with a more personalized feel for each user.

Initially, we thought of our web application, AggieTube, to be a portal for users to search their 
favorite music videos, select and watch a video, and have the option to save the videos to their 
very own specialized playlist for easy playback later. To enhance the application, we decided on the
addition of “Friends”, which would allow the users to watch and save videos they may find entertaining, 
along with promote the social aspect our generation seems to enjoy.

In the process of developing this application we will use a combination of a few programming languages 
and technologies. We’ve selected PostgreSQL as our database, because it is what our team has the most 
experience using. This open source database also allows for the usage of JSON, which will prohibit the 
addition of new features over time with ease. We’ll use Firebase Authentication for user authentication. 
To grab video data, we will utilize the YouTube API. As far as programming languages, for the look and 
feel of the webpage, we will utilize a combination of Python, HTML/CSS, and Javascript through the use 
of Flask. To deploy our application we will take advantage of the cloud application platform, Heroku. 
Finally, to track all of our progress of development we will operate through GitHub.
